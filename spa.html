                        <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we
                            understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will
                            make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another
                            therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for
                            being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation
                            and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.A Free Voucher for
                            a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the Couples
                            Resort.
                            The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the
                            cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort
                            could not provide you.</p>
