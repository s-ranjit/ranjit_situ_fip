                        Molding and Body wraps you will just have on your robe and an undergarment, and can change in
                        the Treatment Room.
                        Appointments can be held between 9:00 am to 9:00 pm. Appointments can be made for up to 2 people
                        at a time, depending on accommodation size and availability of the Spa Practitioners.
                        100 Percent of the full treatment price will be charged to your account for cancellations and
                        no-shows made less than twelve (12) hours prior to the appointment time.
                        For Success in an Algonquin Spa Experience in Rejuvenation please pre-book your appointment.
                        Please note that we cannot guarantee that even with a pre-booking that you will receive your
                        appointment due to illness or extenuating circumstances. However, we will inform you as soon as
                        we are aware and work diligently to work with you to find a possible alternative to your
                        booking.
                        * Treatments will automatically be charged to your account, add 13% HST. Please observe a NO
                        EXTRA TIPPING policy, as we wish that you would rather take another appointment, do another
                        activity, have another wine or stay another night…..any of these will help all, far more than a
                        single extra tip.</p>

                        <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we
                            understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will
                            make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another
                            therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for
                            being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation
                            and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.A Free Voucher for
                            a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the Couples
                            Resort.
                            The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the
                            cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort
                            could not provide you.</p>
